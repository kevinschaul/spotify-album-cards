Create printable and scannable cards for albums on Spotify. Print these images on 4x6 paper, and scan them with your Spotify app to open up the album.

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:

    pip install spotify-album-cards

Create a Spotify app [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). Set the redirect URI to be `http://127.0.0.1:9090`.

Create a `.env` file containing your Spotify app's Client ID, Client Secret and redirect URI as follows:

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:9090
```

## Usage

`spotify-album-cards` provides two commands that are meant to be run in order.

### `get-albums`

Downloads all albums from your Spotify account, outputting a csv file.

Usage:

    spotify-album-cards get-albums -o albums.csv

Once downloaded, manually edit the resulting csv file to only include rows for albums that you would like to generate prints for.

### `generate-prints`

Generates images from an albums csv file. Currently creates images suitable for printing on 4x6 paper, with up to six albums per card.

Usage:

    spotify-album-cards generate-prints -i albums.csv -o prints

Following that command, `prints/` will contain images like this:
